This R code reads through a text file that contains description of polygon (Eg: boundary description of a protected area) and point data (Latitude (N) and Longitude (E)) to create and export the boundary polygon.

eg text : North : Starting from the point of the GPS co-ordinates Lat. N 12 05 31.19 Long. E 77 10 32.12 the line goes
straight towards North-east upto the GPS co-ordinate Lat. N 12 05 32.68 Long. E 77 10 40.14 then the line goes straight
towards South-east upto the GPS co-ordinate Lat. N 12 05 20.17 Long. E 77 11 05.38 from there the line goes straight
